				<h4><strong>Recent Advances of Industrial AI Augmented CPS for Highly Connected and Complex Industrial Systems </strong><br></h4>
				<!--p class="blue"><strong>May 10, 2021  07:20-08:20 PDT</strong></p-->
				<strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
				<p>AI is one of the most powerful technologies of our time, with broad applications with capabilities to predict the invisible problems to avoid, and ultimately to create a worry-free and resilient system. 
					According to a recent study report from National Academy of Engineering, the key issues to successfully develop and deploy AI for industrial applications including the lack of good quality of data as well as lack of systematic approach in developing and validating AI. 
					This presentation will give an introduction about recent advances of Industrial AI for highly complex engineering systems. 
					First, Industrial AI systematic approach and non-traditional machine learning techniques will be introduced. 
					Case studies on lessons learned from different industries including semiconductor manufacturing, wind farm, electrification, and healthcare/medical systems, etc. will be given. 
					In addition, issues data quality and training industrial AI skills through data foundry for high performance and real-time data analytics in future talents will be discussed.</p>
			<!--p>After presenting the scientific and technical background behind Industrial Systems-of-Cyber Physical Systems (ICPS), their relationship to other frameworks like Systems‐of‐Systems Engineering, Industry 4.0, Industrial Internet‐of‐Things (IIoT), and associated technology standardization/normalization initiatives (such as e.g. DIN SPEC 91345 RAMI4.0), this Plenary Talk offers an overview of major requirements to educating, teaching, training people (workers with or without decision-making responsibilities in an Industry 4.0 system, as well as students, technicians and engineers) for learning, living and working with Systems-of-ICPS in a digitalized eco-system. </p>
				<p>The audience/participants of the Talk will get a deep view about: </p>
				<p>
				<li>Which is the minimal necessary pre-existing Know-How for trainees, students and teachers/lecturers in order to educate for learning, living and work (engineering, operating, interacting with ISoCPS? </li>
				<li>What and How to learn ISoCPS? (Recommendations for graduated and post-graduate students, as well as for industrialists) </li>
					<li>What and How to educate and teach ISoCPS? (Recommendations for trainees, educators, teachers, etc.). Lessons learned from own experience educating ICPS at Master Degree level. </li>
				<li>Which should be the essential and unavoidable body of knowledge for building an educational curriculum for learning ISoCPS (presentation and discussion of an exemplary curriculum for achieving a Master of Sciences in Industrial Informatics with Specialization in Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems)?</li>

				<h4><strong>Engineering Cyber-Physical Systems: <em>A Nature-Inspired Simplexity Approach</em></strong> </h4>
				<p class="blue"><strong>May 10, 2021  15:00-16:00 PDT</strong></p>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
				<p>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) represent a broad range of complex, physically aware engineered systems which integrate information and communication technologies (ICT) into physical systems for efficient and effective automation and control. A typical example is a smart grid which allows affordable and secure power supply and use while helping reduce carbon footprints. Recent fast ICT advances have made situation awareness possible for better management and operation of CPS. This has also led to explosive growth of spatio-temporal information and complexity.  An innovative way of thinking and doing is needed to tackle these large-scale complex problems efficiently and effectively.  <p>
			<p>In this talk, we will first review recent developments in CPS and their challenges. We will then advocate a novel problem-solving paradigm, the so-called simplexity approach underpinned by a ‘simple solutions for complex problems’ philosophy, to deal with large-scale complex CPS. Several nature-inspired methodologies such as AI, swarm intelligence and complex networks will be examined. Challenging issues for the simplexity approach for CPS will be outlined. Some real-world problems, such as money laundering network detection and autonomous microgrid network for power supply from our own research projects, will be used as case studies. 
				</p>

				<h4><strong>Space Robots: From Rigid Manipulators to Flexible Ones</strong></h4>
				<p class = "blue" ><strong>May 11, 2021  07:00-08:00 PDT</strong></p>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
				<p>
			Space robotics is known as an inter-discipline research area that has close ties with advanced manufacturing, information and communication technology, and intelligent control. Although it serves as a promising and powerful tool to diverse aero-space applications including spacecraft repair and maintenance, space junk clean-up, and large space system construction, there are also great challenges. In this report, we will firstly summarize the current status and the prospects of the space robot technique along with its applications in on-orbit servicing. Then the technical challenges and new research findings of freefloating space robots are introduced. Finally, we cover the technical difficulties and progress of the next-generation flexible thin and long space manipulator which has strong motion capacity. </p>

				<h4><strong>Intelligent Alarm Monitoring of Complex Industrial Processes</strong></h4>
				<p class = "blue" ><strong>May 11, 2021  08:00-09:00 PDT</strong></p>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
				<p>
			In operating industrial facilities, alarm systems are configured to notify operators about any abnormal situation. The industrial standards (EEMUA and ISA) suggest that on average an operator should not receive more than six alarms per hour. This is, however, rarely the case in practice as the number of alarms each operator receives is far more than the standard. </p>
				<p>			
			
			There exist strong industrial needs and economic benefits for better interpreting and managing the alarms, and redesigning the alarm systems to reduce false and nuisance alarms, and increase the alarm accuracy. In this talk, we plan to summarize our recent work in this new area, targeting an intelligent and data-based approach, called “alarm analytics,” and presenting a new set of advanced tools for alarm visualization, performance evaluation and analysis, alarm rationalization design, alarm flood classification, and root cause analysis, thereby to help industrial processes to comply with the new standards. The tools have been tested with real industrial data and used by process engineers in Canada and elsewhere.
