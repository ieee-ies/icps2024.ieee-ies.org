		<strong>Speaker:</strong> Chad Lloyd<br>
		<strong>Abstract:</strong> Critical infrastructure continues to age and cybersecurity attacks are becoming more complex and prevalent. This talk discusses how attackers are increasingly using social engineering, assisted by artificial intelligence, to penetrate these systems. Compounding the issue is that many of the systems were designed to be isolated, some lacking even basic security controls such as firewalls. As these previously isolated systems are becoming connected to the Internet (sometimes inadvertently) they are now more susceptible than ever to attack.<br>
		We will discuss strategies using modern techniques to secure these architectures. We will focus on the selection of Operational Technology (OT) protections and how they compare and contrast to their Information Technology (IT) counterparts. We’ll mention some standards to help along the way and some pitfalls to avoid on the journey.<br>
		Are you confident in your critical asset’s security posture?<br>

		<strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Christopher Vo<br>
		<strong>Abstract:</strong> Underway replenishment (UNREP) is a critical naval operation that allows ships to receive fuel, supplies, and personnel while at sea, enabling sustained operations without the need to return to port. The transition towards unmanned sea vessels (USVs) for these tasks aims to revolutionize underway replenishment capability by adding operational flexibility, reducing risks to human life, and lowering costs. However, this transition is fraught with many technical challenges. Unmanned vessels must be capable of precise navigation and control in dynamic sea states, harsh weather conditions, and complex maritime environments. In part, this requires a combination of perception algorithms and a control regime able to use cross-sensor data inference to characterize changes in system operation, rapidly prune solution spaces to reconstitute control under changed dynamics, and identify areas of non-destructive controllability by continually re-calculating dynamic operating limits. This talk will introduce the UNREP use case and the progress that Saab and Purdue University have made in our pursuit of model-free, adaptive, and real-time perception and control methodologies to address this dynamic problem.<br>
		<strong>Biography:</strong> Dr. Christopher Vo is a robotics scientist whose research has centered upon scalable, robust, and high performance algorithms for unmanned systems autonomy. Throughout his career, Christopher has worked to move ideas out of the laboratory and into the real world. He serves as the Deputy Chief Scientist of Autonomy and Artificial Intelligence for Saab, Inc., providing technical direction and overseeing execution of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and Office of Naval Research (ONR) programs involving advanced controls and situational awareness capabilities.<br>
		Christopher is a prior startup founder and has served as the Chief Scientist for Sentien Robotics, which makes the Hive, a drone fleet aircraft carrier that makes large-scale drone swarm autonomy possible. During his time at Sentien Robotics, he worked on numerous research projects with DARPA, the United States Marine Corps, and Air Force Research Laboratory involving robust multi-vehicle planning, autonomy software architectures, distributed sensor data processing, and airspace planning and deconfliction.<br>
		Christopher holds a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from George Mason University, where he developed robust and scalable algorithms for the monitoring and control of swarms and wrote several published works in the areas of multi-agent systems and probabilistic motion planning. He has also co-founded and served as Vice President of the Drone User Group Network, one of the largest networks of civilian recreational and small commercial drone users in the United States of America. Through his educational efforts at the Drone User Group Network, he has taught hundreds of people how to build and safely operate a drone of their own.

		<td height="65" align="left" valign="top"><strong>Talk-07</strong> • Software Design Automation for Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems<br>
		<strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Marten Lohstroh<br>
		<strong>Abstract:</strong> Software in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) used to predominantly be confined to small single-core embedded processors, but the rise of network technologies and multi-core architectures has started to reshape the habitat of embedded software and continues to expand its ability and reach. This has culminated in a push for a “software-defined” paradigm in industries (e.g., automotive, industrial automation) that are still very much hardware-centric but want to reap the benefits of cost reduction, quicker prototyping, virtualization, better infrastructure for handling data that can be learned from, over-the-air updates, CI/CD, and a reduction in number of hardware components and amount of wiring.<br>
		Major challenges stand in the way of realizing this vision, however. Interference between software tasks can cause a system to malfunction or become unsafe. Running multiple applications on the same compute node requires careful coordination, but so does running a single software application across multiple compute nodes. In either configuration, complex software engineering challenges loom—ones that are simply not present in single-threaded code that runs on classical embedded microprocessors. Perhaps, more importantly, these challenges are orthogonal to the core functionality of the application. Issues like race conditions, deadlocks, non-determinism, priority inversion, and timing anomalies can pose serious safety risks, and the overhead of addressing these problems may quickly start to overwhelm application programmers. Contrary to what the software-defined paradigm promises, this has the potential of reducing programmer productivity and project velocity, driving up development costs, and posing serious safety concerns.<br>
		Very similarly, overwhelming complexity, inherent concurrency, non-determinism, and sensitivity to timing were problems that in the earlier days of integrated circuit design stood in the way of realizing its full potential. The answer to these problems came in the form of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools that have facilitated the integrated circuit industry in coping with the exponential growth in product complexity, while simultaneously ensuring consistent product development timelines and costs. What can we learn from EDA to address the challenges posed by software in modern, software-defined CPS? What would Software Design Automation (SDA) for CPS look like? In this talk, I will discuss these questions, and survey principles, tools, and methodologies for SDA that we can leverage today.<br>
		<strong>Biography:</strong> Dr. Marten Lohstroh is co-founder and CEO of Xronos Inc., a startup company that develops tools and services for building complex software-defined cyber-physical systems that span deeply embedded, edge, and cloud platforms. He also holds a staff researcher position at UC Berkeley in the group of Prof. Edward A. Lee where he leads the development of the Lingua Franca coordination language. He received a B.S. degree in computer science (2009), a M.S. in grid computing (2013), both from the University of Amsterdam, and holds a PhD in computer science (2020) from UC Berkeley.
